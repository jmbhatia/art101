			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with my partner to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a little trouble getting my console functions to work properly. I also temporaily forgot how to assign a variable to an array. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I ran out of brain power to complete this assignment timely. It took me alot longer than I had hoped because it was hard to focus on the task at hand. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>Go to the console to see output!</p>
