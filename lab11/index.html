			<h1>Lab 11: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this assignment is to create a fuction that will gather user input and return it in alphabetical order.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The first problem, I ran into was that the submit button did not do anything. I got it to show up on my page but it didn't output anything.</p>
                    <p>Secoundly, I was confused on how exactly to link the Javascript to my page, but I used my hompage links as reference and got it done.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After many ups and downs I got my function to work. I keep forgeting to include the append and return commands within the fuction brackets. But I was able to fix it on my own this time without Adams help so that was a big win. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Input</h2>
                    <input  type="text" id="user-name" placeholder="Input your name">
                    <ul><button id="submit">Submit</button></ul>
                    <h2>Output</h2>
                    <div id="output"></div>
